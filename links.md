A curated collection of links to sites that I think are worth checking out.

### The Obvious Stuff

Sites that a lot of people know, but still are worth putting up for completion's sake.

[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) - The best source of easily accessible information on the internet.

[xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) - Everyone's favorite webcomic.

[The arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) - Best place to read the most up-to-date papers in physics.

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) - Great forum for tech discussion.

### Interesting Reads

Other people's sites that have some pretty interesting content.

[RMS's Personal Site](https://stallman.org/) - Stallman may be a bit crazy, and I don't agree with everything he says, but he does raise a few good points.

[The Adventures of OS](https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/) - Stephen Marz's attempt at making a RISC-V OS with Rust.

### Privacy Information

Some site's to help you live a private and secure life.

[PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io/) - Great guide to help you replace various software tools with more private alternatives.

[Surveillence Self-Defence](https://ssd.eff.org/) - Well written collection of guides on how to stay more private published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

[The Right to Privacy](/assets/privacy.pdf) - Paper published in the Harvard Law Review way back in 1890 that raises arguments for privacy that are still valid today.

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) - Free service that provides `TLS` certificates. If you have a website that doesn't use `HTTPS`, please grab a free certificate from Let's Encrypt and secure your site.

### Great Software

Link's to some great software that I recommend.

[Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) - My Linux distro of choice. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what distro you use, but I do recommend picking one and trying it out to replace Windows/OS X.

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) - Hands down the best text editor. Check out my config [here](https://github.com/lordskh/dotfiles).

[i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) - Highly functional tiling window manager. Check out my config [here](https://github.com/lordskh/dotfiles).

[Signal](https://signal.org/) - The most secure messaging platform. Based on recent commits it looks like its one main weakness, using cell phone numbers as the only identifier, is going to be fixed soon.

### Other

Some other sites to check out.

[Pine64](https://www.pine64.org/) - Great organization making some cool hardware. I currently daily drive their PineBook Pro and it's amazingly capable for a $200 machine.

[The Worst Website I Have Ever Seen](https://yzhan289.github.io/personal-website/) - This site is a perfect example of everything wrong with modern design. Thanks to Yifan Zhang for making this monstrosity.
