A curated collection of links to sites that I think are worth checking out.

### The Obvious Stuff

Sites that a lot of people know, but still are worth putting up for completion's sake.

[Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) - The best source of easily accessible information on the internet.

[xkcd](https://xkcd.com/) - Everyone's favorite webcomic.

[The arXiv](https://arxiv.org/) - Best place to read the most up-to-date papers in physics.

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/) - Great forum for tech discussion.

### Interesting Reads

Other people's sites that have some pretty interesting content.

[RMS's Personal Site](https://stallman.org/) - Stallman may be a bit crazy, and I don't agree with everything he says, but he does raise a few good points.

[The Adventures of OS](https://osblog.stephenmarz.com/) - Stephen Marz's attempt at making a RISC-V OS with Rust.

[Drew DeVault's Blog](https://drewdevault.com/) - Blog of the guy behind projects like [sway](https://swaywm.org/) and [sourcehut](https://sr.ht/).

[Hundred Rabbits](https://100r.co) - Two people who live on a boat full time while sailing around the world.

[A Collection of Unmitigated Pedantry](acoup.blog) - Super in depth blog with posts mostly relating to history.

[Paul Graham Essays](http://paulgraham.com/articles.html) - Essays from one of the brains behind Y Combinator, some super insightful stuff here.

[Low Tech Magazine](https://solar.lowtechmagazine.com/) - Solar powered website with articles that are largely about sustainability.

### Privacy Information

Some site's to help you live a private and secure life.

[PrivacyTools](https://www.privacytools.io/) - Great guide to help you replace various software tools with more private alternatives.

[Surveillence Self-Defence](https://ssd.eff.org/) - Well written collection of guides on how to stay more private published by the Electronic Frontier Foundation.

[The Right to Privacy](/assets/privacy.pdf) - Paper published in the Harvard Law Review way back in 1890 that raises arguments for privacy that are still valid today.

[Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) - Free service that provides `TLS` certificates. If you have a website that doesn't use `HTTPS`, please grab a free certificate from Let's Encrypt and secure your site.

### Great Software

Link's to some great software that I recommend.

[Fedora Linux](https://getfedora.org/) - My Linux distro of choice. At the end of the day it doesn't really matter what distro you use, but I do recommend picking one and trying it out to replace Windows/OS X.

[Vim](https://www.vim.org/) - Hands down the best text editor. Check out my config [here](https://github.com/lordskh/dotfiles).

[i3wm](https://i3wm.org/) - Highly functional tiling window manager. Check out my config [here](https://github.com/lordskh/dotfiles).

[Signal](https://signal.org/) - The most secure messaging platform. Based on recent commits it looks like its one main weakness, using cell phone numbers as the only identifier, is going to be fixed soon.

### Other

Some other sites to check out.

[Iffy Books](https://iffybooks.net/) - Bookstore-cum-hackerspace in Philadelphia.
Not only do they regularly host cool events, but you are almost guaranteed interesting conversation here and I have yet to meet anyone here that isn't great.
If you are a computer nerd in Philadelphia definitely check it out.

[Pine64](https://www.pine64.org/) - Great organization making some cool hardware.
~~I currently daily drive their PineBook Pro and it's amazingly capable for a $200 machine.~~
**UPDATE:** I no longer own my PineBook Pro, while it was fast enough for the rare occasions that I need a laptop in my day to day operations (I have a desktop both at home and in the lab) it wasn't good enough for when I travel and am using a laptop full time.

[The Best Website I Have Ever Seen](https://motherfuckingwebsite.com/) - This site (somewhat satirically) explains the problems with modern web design.

[The Worst Website I Have Ever Seen](https://yzhan289.github.io/) - This site is a perfect example of everything wrong with modern design. Thanks to Yifan Zhang for making this monstrosity.
**UPDATE:** Looks like Yifan took this site down but an [archived copy](https://web.archive.org/web/20211202024746/https://andrewzhang.dev/) is available.
