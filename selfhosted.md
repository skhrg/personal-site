I self host a number of services on my server.
Below is a list of them with internal links for my convenience as well as links to the websites for these services.

* [Cockpit](cockpit.saianeesh.com) - Administration and status panels for Linux servers, also has a terminal built in which is useful when I am using a computer without my ssh keys ([project page](https://cockpit-project.org/))
* [qBittorrent](qbt.saianeesh.com) - WebUI for my torrent client of choice ([project page](https://www.qbittorrent.org/))
* [Jellyfin](jellyfin.saianeesh.com) - Open source Plex alternative ([project page](https://jellyfin.org/))
* [Funkwhale](funkwhale.saianeesh.com) - Music streaming with some federation features, thinking of dropping this is favor of just using Jellyfin for music as well ([project page](https://funkwhale.audio/))
* [Vikunja](vikunja.saianeesh.com) - To-do software that I mostly use for software projects, the kanban interface is quite useful but it isn't as powerful as alternatives like Notion ([project page](https://vikunja.io))
